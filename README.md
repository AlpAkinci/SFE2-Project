MileStone 1 Requirements
- Make a Use Case, Data Flow Diagram, and Class Diagram (for what we can loosely expect of system architecture, user interaction and potential functionality) - for software specification expectations
- Make a solid foundation of UI (with few button functionality - meaning being able to open menus and switch pages) (not a finalized version)
- finalize communication efforts (make sure we can all effectively communicate with one another)
- Divvy up roles for current plan (more responsibilities will be given as we add onto software as we all see best fit)
