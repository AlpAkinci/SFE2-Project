- Make a solid foundation of UI (with few button functionality - meaning being able to open menus and switch pages) (not a finalized version)
- Finalize communication efforts (make sure we can all effectively communicate with one another)
- Divvy up roles for current plan (more responsibilities will be given as we add onto software as we all see best fit)
